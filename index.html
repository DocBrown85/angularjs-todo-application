                                With the ng-model directive you can bind the value of an input field to a variable
                                created in AngularJS.
                                In this case we are bounding the "checked" status of the checkbox to the allChecked
                                variable.

                                The data-ng-click directive defines AngularJS code that will be executed when the
                                element is being clicked.
                                In our case, when the element is clicked, the function markAll() will be executed,
                                passing the value of the variable allChecked as the argument.

                    The ng-repeat directive repeats a set of HTML, a given number of times.
                    The set of HTML will be repeated once per item in a collection, which
                    must be an array or an object.

                    Note: Each instance of the repetition is given its own scope, which consist
                    of the current item.

                    array holding all todos we are creating.

                    We are also using filters:

                    - orderBy, which allows to sort an array by an expression. In our case we are
                      ordering by the 'text' property of the todo items.

                    - filter, which allows to filter a collection by a predicate. In our case we are
                      filtering by an object (statusFilter) which will specify the property and its value
                      we are filtering by.

                        If it is a string, it should contain one or more, space-separated class names.
                        As an object, it should contain key-value pairs, where the key is the class name
                        of the class you want to add, and the value is a boolean value.
                        The class will only be added if the value is set to true.

                    You configure ngPluralize directive by specifying the mappings between plural categories and
                    the strings to be displayed.

                    You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: count and when.
                    You can also provide an optional attribute, offset.

                    The value of the count attribute can be either a string or an AngularJS expression;
                    these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.

                    The when attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
                    string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.

                    Here we are configuring ng-pluralize to display '{} item left' or '{} items left'
                    depending on the value of the 'remainingCount' variable to be 1 or not.

                            With the ng-class directive we are dynamically assigning the class "active" to 
                            the button depending on the value of the expression "filteringBy == 'completed'",
                            where "filteringBy" is a variable in our application's scope.

                            With the ng-click directive we are binding the execution of the function
                            filterBy() (which receives the string 'completed' as the first argument) on 
                            "click" events occurring to the button.
